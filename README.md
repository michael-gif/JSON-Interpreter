# JSON-Interpreter
This java package will allow you to read json.

- It takes in a file with the json in it. For example `json.txt`
- It outputs an `ArrayList` which contains `HashMaps`.  
- Each HashMap is a JSON object.  
- The HashMap's have `String` keys and `HashMapValue` values.  
- A `HashMapValue` instance has a `String` attribute for string values and an `ArrayList` attribute for nested JSON objects.
